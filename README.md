eNvy Engine 
=========

This is my senior project which is a 2.5D game engine with a demo envierment. The engine combines a lot of the rastertek tutorials with a rewritten model class and modified control of camera to link up with player movement. The parts that I wrote excusivly is the scene graph and the collision detection.

The reason basing the framework on the rastertek tutorials was unfilmiarity with HLSL and some of the more advance features of Direct X 11. However since rastertek uses some of the tutorials as a one and done and has only very few consitant parts of its framework I combined the code base into one giant project. 

Information about what I created and what I modified can be found in the wiki.
