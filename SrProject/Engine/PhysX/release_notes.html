<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">April 2012</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.2</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added migration guide page from 3.1 to 3.2 to user's guide.</li>
		<li>Three new sample applications:  SampleCharacterCloth (character with cloth cape and cloth flags), SampleBridges (character controller walking on dynamic bridges and moving platforms), SampleCustomGravity (character controller with arbitrary up vector).</li>
		<li>On Windows, the PxFoundation instance is now a process wide singleton and part of the new PhysX3Common.dll library</li>
		<li>PxCreatePhysics() does not create a PxFoundation instance any longer. The PxFoundation instance has to be created in advance through PxCreateFoundation().</li>
		<li>Calls to PxCreatePhysics() are not valid anymore if a PxPhysics instance already exists.</li>
		<li>If profiling information should be sent to the PhysX Visual Debugger, a PxProfileZoneManager instance has to be provided when creating the PxPhysics instance.</li>
		<li>The version number constant PX_PUBLIC_FOUNDATION_VERSION has been replaced with PX_PHYSICS_VERSION. Both PxFoundation and PxPhysics use the same version number now.</li>
		<li>The API now distinguishes between input and output stream types.</li>
		<li>Added mechanism to reduce code size by not linking optional components.  See PxCreateBasePhysics() and the PxRegister*() functions.</li>
		<li>Added getConcreteTypeName() to API classes to provide run time type information.</li>
		<li>Added PxScene::getTimestamp() to retrieve the simulation counter.</li>
		<li>PxGetFoundation has been moved to PxGetFoundation.h</li>
		<li>The signature of PxCreatePhysics has changed:  The Foundation SDK instance must be passed in explicitly.  One can also hook profiling information by passing a PxProfileZoneManager.</li>
		<li>contact data block allocation now provides statistics on usage and max usage</li>
		<li>On all platforms except PS3, contact data blocks can be progressively allocated</li>
		<li>PxExtensionVisualDebugger has been renamed to PxVisualDebuggerExt, PxExtensionsConnectionType renamed to PxVisualDebuggerConnectionFlag</li>
		<li>Default implementations of memory and file streams added in PxDefaultStreams.h</li>
		<li>Renamed PxPhysics::getMetaData() to ::PxGetSDKMetaData().</li>
		<li>Scene::simulate() now takes a memory block which is used for allocation of temporary data during simulation</li>
		<li>On Windows, CudaContextManagerDesc support appGUID now. It only works on release build. If your application employs PhysX modules that use CUDA you need to use a GUID so that patches for new architectures can be released for your game.You can obtain a GUID for your application from Nvidia.</li>		
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Introduced a new contact generation mode, see eENABLE_PCM.  Note that this is an experimental feature that still shows simulation artifacts in some scenarios.</li>
		<li>Introduced two new friction simulation modes, see eENABLE_ONE_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION and eENABLE_TWO_DIRECTIONAL_FRICTION.</li>
		<li>Introduced a new scene query flag PxSceneQueryFlag::eINITIAL_OVERLAP_KEEP to control how initial overhaps are treated in scene queries.</li>
		<li>Per-triangle materials have been implemented.</li>
		<li>Changes to material properties are automatically reflected in contact resolution.</li>
		<li>New helper methods to compute mass properties for a dynamic rigid body taking per shape density/mass values into account (see documentation on PxRigidBodyExt for details).</li>
		<li>A new set of methods for overlap, sweep and raycast tests based on PxGeometry objects has been introduced. See documentation on PxMeshQuery and PxGeometryQuery for details).</li>
		<li>The contact report API has changed (for details see the documentation on PxSimulationEventCallback::onContact()). Among the changes are:
		<ul>
			<li>Reports only get sent for shape pairs which request them. Previously, reports were sent for an actor pair even if the requested shape pair event was not triggered (for example because other shapes of the same actors started colliding etc.)</li>
			<li>The following PxPairFlags have been removed eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCES, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FORCE_PER_POINT, eNOTIFY_CONTACT_FEATURE_INDICES_PER_POINT. Forces and feature indices are now always provided if applicable.</li>
			<li>It is much easier now to skip shape pairs or contact point information when traversing the contact report data.</li>
			<li>The memory footprint of contact reports has been reduced.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The members featureIndex0/1 of PxContactPoint have been renamed to internalFaceIndex0/1 for consistency.</li>
		<li>For trigger reports, the eNOTIFY_TOUCH_PERSISTS event has been deprecated and will be removed in the next release. For performance and flexibility reasons it is recommended to use eNOTIFY_TOUCH_FOUND and eNOTIFY_TOUCH_LOST only and manage the persistent state separately.</li>
		<li>Added PxConstraintVisualizer interface and code to visualize joint frames and limits.</li>
		<li>Improved PxBatchQuery API.</li>
		<li>PxPhysics::getProfileZoneManager() now returns a pointer rather than a reference.</li>
		<li>PxRigidDynamic::moveKinematic() has been renamed to setKinematicTarget() to underline its precise semantics.</li>
		<li>Added new function PxShape::getGeometry and class PxGeometryHolder to improve Geometry APIs.</li>
		<li>PxCreatePlane now takes a PxPlane equation as a parameter. Note that the interpretation of the distance value is negated relative to 3.1</li>
		<li>Added new actor creation helpers PxCloneStatic, PxCloneDynamic, PxScaleActor.</li>
		<li>Added new functions PxTransformFromSegment, PxTransformFromPlaneEquation to simplify creation of planes and capsules.</li>
		<li>added PxJoint::getConstraint() to access the underlying constraint object, from which the constraint force can be read</li>
		<li>Some methods of PxAggregate have been renamed for consistency or replaced for extended functionality.
		<ul>
			<li>getMaxSize() is now called getMaxNbActors().</li>
			<li>getCurrentSize() is now called getNbActors().</li>
			<li>getActor() has been replaced by getActors() which copies the actor pointers to a user buffer.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added support for kinematic triangle meshes, planes and heighfields.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Scene queries</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Dynamic AABBTree has been set as the default dynamic pruning structure.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed descriptors from particle API: The properties maxParticles and PxParticleBaseFlag::ePER_PARTICLE_REST_OFFSET need to be specified when calling PxPhysics::createParticleSystem() and createParticleFluid(). All other properties can be adjusted after creation through set methods.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Cloth</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added convex collision shapes, see PxCloth::addCollisionConvex()</li>
		<li>Added friction support, see PxCloth::setFrictionCoefficient()</li>
		<li>Added angle based bending constraints, see PxClothPhaseSolverConfig::SolverType::eBENDING</li>
		<li>Added separation constraints, a spherical volume that particles should stay outside of, see PxCloth::setSeparationConstraints()</li>
		<li>Added drag, see PxCloth::setDragCoefficient()</li>
		<li>Added inertia scaling, controls how much movement due to PxCloth::setTargetPose() will affect the cloth</li>
		<li>Added support for setting particle previous positions, see PxCloth::setParticles()</li>
		<li>Added controls for scaling particle mass during collision, this can help reduce edge stretching around joints on characters, see PxCloth::setCollisionMassScale()</li>
		<li>Particle data is now copied asynchronously from the GPU after simulate (rather than on demand)</li>
		<li>Improved fabric layout, you can now share fabric data across multiple phases to reduce memory usage, see PxClothFabric</li>
		<li>Fixed bug in collision when capsules are tapered at a slope > 1</li>
	</ul>
        
	<h4>Vehicles</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added PxVehicleDriveTank, a vehicle class that enables tank behaviors.</li>
		<li>Support for vehicles with more than 4 wheels, see PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicleDriveTank.</li>
		<li>Significant refactor of vehicle api to allow further types of vehicle to be added.</li>
		<li>Americal English spelling used in vehicle api.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4W replaced with PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicle4WSimulationData replaced with PxVehicleDriveSimData4W.</li>
		<li>Removal of scene query helper functions and structs: PxVehicle4WSceneQueryData, PxVehicle4WSetUpSceneQuery, PxWheelRaycastPreFilter, PxSetupDrivableShapeQueryFilterData, PxSetupNonDrivableShapeQueryFilterData, PxSetupVehicleShapeQueryFilterData. See SampleVehicle_SceneQuery.h for their implementation in SampleVehicle.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WSimpleSetup and PxCreateVehicle4WSimulationData have been removed and replaced with default values in vehicle components, see PxVehicleComponents.h.</li>
		<li>PxVehicle4WTelemetryData has been replaced with PxVehicleTelemetryData, a class that supports vehicles with any number of wheels, see PxVehicleTelemetryData</li>
		<li>PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceType no longer stored in PxMaterial::userData.  A hash table of PxMaterial pointers is instead used to associate each PxMaterial with a PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceType, see PxVehicleDrivableSurfaceToTireFrictionPairs.</li>
		<li>PxVehicleTyreData::mLongitudinalStiffness has been replaced with PxVehicleTireData::mLongitudinalStiffnessPerUnitGravity, see PxVehicleTireData.</li>
		<li>Tire forces now computed from a shader to allow user-specified tire force functions, see PxVehicleTireForceCalculator.</li>
		<li>Added helper functions to quickly configure 3-wheeled cars, see PxVehicle4WEnable3WTadpoleMode, PxVehicle4WEnable3WDeltaMode.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h4>Serialization</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed the functions PxPhysics::releaseUserReferences(), releaseCollection(), addCollection() and releaseCollected() to now take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
		<li>Platform conversion for serialized data has been moved from the ConvX command line tool to the PxBinaryConverter interface in the cooking library.</li>
		<li>Changed some functions in RepXUtility.h and RepX.h to take a reference rather than a pointer.</li>
    </ul>
    

	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Deformables have been removed. Use the optimized solution for clothing simulation instead (see documentation on PxCloth for details).</li>
		<li>PxSweepCache is deprecated.</li>
		<li>PVD is no longer enabled in the release build.</li>
		<li>Removed anisotropic friction.</li>
		<li>Removed the CCD mode eSWEPT_CONTACT_PAIRS.</li>
		<li>PxActorDesc has been removed.</li>
		<li>The ConvX tool has been removed.</li>
		<li>Removed empty default implementations of functions in PxSimulationEventCallback for consistency and because it can create bugs in user code if function prototypes change between releases.  Users must now supply (eventually blank) implementations for all functions.</li>
		<li>Octree and quadtree pruning structures have been removed.</li>
		<li>PxScene.overlapAny has been removed. overlapMultiple with maxNumHits 1 does the same.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Fixed Bugs</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>PxScene::getActors() might not work properly when the startIndex parameter is used.</li>
		<li>Improved the doc-comment of PxConvexMesh::getMassInformation().</li>
        <li>RepX instantiation can lose all internal references when addOriginalIdsToObjectMap is false.</li>
        <li>PxSetGroup crashed when used on a compound.</li>
        <li>PhysXCommon.dll can be delay loaded.</li>
        <li>ContactReportStream can now handle huge report numbers and size (resize-able flag) can be set in PxSceneDesc.h.</li>
        <li>Fixed assert in sweep tests.</li>
		<li>Concurrent read/write operations during a PxScene::fetchResults() call were not detected properly and no warning message got sent in checked builds. Forbidden write operations during callbacks triggered by PxScene::fetchResults() (contact/trigger reports etc.) were not covered either.</li>
        <li>Fixed crash bug that occurred during collision detection when more than 16K of contact data was generated.  Contacts that generate more than 16K of contact data are now fully supported.</li>
		<li>Fixed crash bug when PhysX Visual Debugger is connected and an object gets modified and then released while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>

<h2><br>
<a name="knownissues320">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>

	<h4>Binary Serialization</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Meta data generation for PxParticleFluid and PxParticleSystem serializables currently fails.</li>
		<li>For collections that contain jointed rigid bodies all corresponding joints need to be added as well, otherwise deserialization will fail.
	</ul>
	<h4>Rigid Body Simulation</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Capsules and spheres can struggle to come to rest on even perfectly flat surfaces. To ensure these objects come to rest, it is necessary to increase angular damping on rigid bodies made of these shapes. In addition, flagging the capsule/sphere's material with physx::PxMaterialFlag::eDISABLE_STRONG_FRICTION can help bring these shapes to rest.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Character Cloth Sample</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>An NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 2.0 or higher is required for GPU accelerated simulation in the SampleCharacterCloth sample, if no such device is present then simulation will be performed on the CPU.</li>
		<li>Note that this is not a general SDK requirement, the clothing SDK supports cards with Compute Capability < 2.0 but with limitations on mesh size.</li>
	</ul>

<h1 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><br>Release Notes - NVIDIA PhysX SDK 3.0</h1>

<h2 style="TEXT-ALIGN: center">February 14<sup>th</sup>2011</h2>

<h2>What's New In NVIDIA PhysX 3.0</h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>General</h4>

	This third major version of the SDK is a significant rewrite of the entire technology.  We did away with a large amount of legacy clutter and replaced them with a wealth of new features and improvements.
	Because even the API changes are so significant, it is easier to see it as a whole new product rather than a long list of changes.

	<h4>What we removed:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The dedicated NVIDIA PhysX PPU hardware is not supported any more.</li>
		<li>Scene compartments are not supported anymore. All created physical objects are now part of one and the same compartment.</li>
		<li>Force fields are not part of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK anymore.</li>
		<li>Splitting a simulation timestep into multiple substeps is not a functionality of the NVIDIA PhysX SDK any longer and has to be implemented above the SDK.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Key new features:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Articulations: A way to create very stiff joint assemblies.</li>
		<li>Serialization: Save objects in a binary format and load them back quickly!</li>
		<li>Broad Phase Clustering: Put objects that belong together into a single broadphase volume.</li>
		<li>Driverless Model: No need to worry about system software on PC anymore.</li>
		<li>Dynamic Character Controller: A character controller that can robustly walk on dynamic objects.</li>
		<li>Vehicle Library: A toolkit to make vehicles, including an all new tire model.</li>
		<li>Non-Simulation Objects: A staging are outside of the simulation from where you can add things into the simulation at high speed.</li>
		<li>Simulation Task Manager: Take control of the management of simulation tasks.</li>
		<li>Stable Depenetration: Large penetrations can be gracefully recovered from.</li>
		<li>Double Buffering: You can read from and write to the simulated objects while the simulation is running on another thread.</li>
		<li>Mesh Scaling: Create different nonuniformly scaled instances of your meshes and convexes without duplicating the memory.</li>
		<li>Distance Based Collision Detection: Have the simulation create contacts before objects touch, and do away with unsightly overlaps.</li>
		<li>Fast Continuous Collision Detection: Have small and high speed objects collide correctly without sacrificing performance.</li>
		<li>Significantly increased performance and memory footprint, especially on consoles.</li>
		<li>Unified solver for deformables and rigid bodies for great interaction.</li>
		<li>Triangle collision detection with deformables.</li>
		<li>Support for our new Physics Visual Debugger, including integrated profiling.</li>
	</ul>


	<h4>Math classes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Matrix based transforms have been replaced by quaternions.</li>
		<li>All angles are now expressed in radians. IN PARTICULAR the PxQuat constructor from
			axis and angle as well as the getAngleAxis and fromAngleAxis methods now use radians rather than degrees.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Capsules are now defined to extend along the x rather than the y axis.</li>
		<li>Triangle meshes do not support heightfield functionality anymore. Use the dedicated PxHeightField class instead.</li>
		<li>Dynamic triangle mesh actors are not supported any longer. However, you can decompose your mesh into convex parts and create a dynamic actor consisting of these convex parts.</li>
		<li>The deprecated heightfield property NxHeightFieldDesc::verticalExtent is not supported any longer. Please use the PxHeightFieldDesc::thickness parameter instead.</li>
		<li>NxSpringAndDamperEffector is not supported anymore. Use PxDistanceJoint instead.</li>
		<li>Joints are now part of the PhysX extensions library (PhysXExtensions).</li>
		<li>Wheel shapes have been replaced by the more flexible entity PxWheel. A default wheel implementation, encapsulating most of the old wheel functionality, can be found in the PhysX extensions library (see PxDefaultWheel).</li>
		<li>The NxUtilLib library has been removed. Sweep/overlap/raycast tests and other helper methods can be found in the new GeomUtils library.</li>
		<li>Materials can no longer be accessed through indices. Per triangle material meshes need a material table which can be specified per shape (see PxShape::setMaterials() for details).</li>
		<li>The default material is not available anymore.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Particle Systems, Particle Fluids</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The NxFluid class has been replaced with two classes for separation of functionality and ease of use.

<a name="knownissues300">Known Issues And Limitations</a></h2>

<blockquote>
	<h4>Rigid Bodies</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Adding or removing a PxAggregate object to the scene is not possible while the simulation is running.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Particle Systems</h4>
	<ul>
	    <li>Releasing the Physics SDK may result in a crash when using GPU accelerated particle systems. </br>
		This can be avoided by doing the following before releasing the Physics SDK:
			<ul>
				<li>Releasing the PxScene objects that contain the GPU accelerated particle systems.</li>
				<li>Releasing application mirrored meshes by calling PxPhysicsGpu::releaseTriangleMeshMirror(...), PxPhysicsGpu::releaseHeightFieldMirror(...) or PxPhysicsGpu::releaseConvexMeshMirror(...).</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
